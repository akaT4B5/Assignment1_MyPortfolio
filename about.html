        <h3>Hi! My name is Tabitha Hannas!</h3>
        <p>I am a second year Information Technology and Networking Security student here at Ontario Tech University. I was born in Vietnam and was adopted to Canada around 4 months old! I love to swim, ski, and play badminton! I have been a swim instructor and lifeguard for the past 4 years and I plan to go back again this spring!</p>
        <p>I found my love of technology at an early age with video games and then later on, coding. Thoughout highschool, I took several tech classes such as Intro to Computer Engineering as well as a few game development classes. </p>
