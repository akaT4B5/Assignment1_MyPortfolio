This portfolio website presents me as a person, my projects, and a way to contact me using semantic HTML5 and CSS3. The site includes four distinct pages : Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact Me presented live on GitHub Pages. The Home page features a cover image, navigation links, and a live date/time display. The About Me page includes a personal photo and a 46 second introductory video with controls and a thumbnail image. The Projects page lists four course projects with short descriptions and images highlighting work from networking, programming, management, and writing courses from my first year. The Contact Me page contains a validated contact form (name, email, message) that saves submissions locally as downloadable text files. I focused on accessibility and responsive, fluid layouts using separate CSS files for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints (documented in the repository). Semantic elements such as header, main, nav, and footer are used throughout. Visual styling uses a consistent color scheme created with Adobe Color, with gradients (including a black-to-purple button gradient) used on interactive elements. The repository includes clear file structure, descriptive commits tracking development stages, and a README documenting the function of the code and goal of the website. Validation and testing steps were performed: HTML validated with W3C Markup Validator, CSS validated with W3C CSS Validator, links checked with W3C Link Checker, spell-checked with LanguageTool, and accessibility evaluated with WAVE.
